#Original data

The original data set is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset", which is available for download from the UCI Machine Learning Repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


#Data set information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 


#Tiday data set 
=================
Tiday set contains 6 columns:

"subject"  - ID of a volounteer who performed activities
"activity" - type of activity performaed
"measures" - following fetaures from the original experimet:
  fBodyAcc
  fBodyAccJerk
  fBodyAccMag
  fBodyBodyAccJerkMag

"mean", "meanFreq", "std" - avrage value per variable, per measure, activity, subject

Tiday data set contains 3060 rows each of them being unique combiation of subject, activity and measure.
